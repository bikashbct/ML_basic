supervised learning vs unsupervised learning
supervised learning 99% ML works in this field from data prediction output variable
-- linear regression -- logistic regression -- 



unsupervised no prediction find the pattern google search implemention from the data optimize made a clustter spot outliers 
It is used to use supervised learning to train only input data Knears algorithm  recommendtion system 


Reinforcement learning not train in everything itself train from itself from the pattern recently used deepseek ai in this learning 
learn by trail or error


EDA-- Explotary Data Analysis
1. Problem Defination 
2. Data collection
3. EDA 
4. Data processing/cleaning
5. Features selection and learning 
6. split the dataset
7. Model selection 
8. Model Training
9. Model Evaluation
10. Hyperparameter Training
11. Model Testing/Validation



EDA--- steps
1. Viewing data head(), tail(), info(), shape
2. Summary Statitics mean, mode, std, max
3. value counts , unique value , repeation 
4. missing value analysis 
5. Visualizations 
6. Target Variable exploration 


----Data Cleaning--
1. Handling Missing values fillna dropna
2. linear regression , KNN or Interpolation
3. Remove Duplicates and drop extact rows
4. Fix Data types
5. Handle Inconstient categories
6. Detect and Handle outliers IQR or Z-score handle by removing and capping 
7. Fix logic and Domain errors


---Data preProcessing--
Transform valid data to useable data encoding one hot encoding 0,1 based on 0,1 



---features Engineering---
suppose data in 2024/11/11 seprate in 3 columns 
binning
mathematicals Comninations
Target Based Flags



---features Selection ----
selecting the most useful features and removing the rest
     why this is important??
1. reduces noise and overfitting
2. speeds up training 
3. improves model accuracy 
4. Makes model interpretion easier   accuracy matters most in ml training 
method
1. Filter methods
correlation , anova 
2. Embeedeed methods
laso regressions



----linear regression---
--cost function (j)= 1/2m sum(i=1,m)(hxi-yi)^2
---gradient descent = minium cost function to predict best fit line 
--if actual value and predicted value is same then cost function will be zero
--repeat convergence therom


----model evaluation technique-----
